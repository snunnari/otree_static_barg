### Salvatore Nunnari, Bocconi University, salvatore.nunnari@unibocconi.it

This repository contains two oTree (www.otree.org) apps:

* **barg_three**: multilateral alternating-offer legislative bargaining with **three-players** as in the model by Baron, David and John Ferejon, 1989, "Bargaining in Legislatures" 
and, among others, the laboratory experiments by Frechette, Guillaume, John Kagel and Steve Lehrer, 2003, "Bargaining in Legislatures: An Experimental Investigation of Open versus Closed Amendment Rules" and Kagel, John, Hankyoung Sung and Eyal Winter, 2010, "Veto Power in Committees: An Experimental Study".
This app implements a single instance of a sequential bargaining game (i.e., a single "match").

* **barg_five**: multilateral alternating-offer legislative bargaining with **five-players** as in the model by Baron, David and John Ferejon, 1989, "Bargaining in Legislatures" 
and, among others, the laboratory experiments by Frechette, Guillaume, John Kagel and Steve Lehrer, 2003, "Bargaining in Legislatures: An Experimental Investigation of Open versus Closed Amendment Rules" and Kagel, John, Hankyoung Sung and Eyal Winter, 2010, "Veto Power in Committees: An Experimental Study".
This app implements a single instance of a sequential bargaining game (i.e., a single "match").

These apps were developed with oTree version 2.1.35.
