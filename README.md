This repository contains one oTree app:

* **barg**: multilateral alternating-offer legislative bargaining with three-players as in the model by Baron, David and John Ferejon, 1989, "Bargaining in Legislatures" 
and, among others, the laboratory experiments by Frechette, Guillaume, John Kagel and Steve Lehrer, 2003, "Bargaining in Legislatures: An Experimental Investigation of Open versus Closed Amendment Rules" and Kagel, John, Hankyoung Sung and Eyal Winter, 2010, "Veto Power in Committees: An Experimental Study".
This app implements a single instance of a sequential bargaining game (i.e., a single "match").
